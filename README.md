## HOW TO SET UP WEBPACK WITH RAILS:
1. Set up your initial Rails project as usual.  [1][1]
2. `npm init` to generate your `package.json`
3. `sudo npm install webpack --save` to install webpack, and similarly install
any other libraries or [webpack loaders][webpack-loaders] you want.  [2-4][2-4]
4. [Decide whether to check your dependencies into version control][commit-modules].
5. Write your webpack.config.  [5][5] (Documentation [here][webpack-config-docs].)
6. In `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` change the require statements to
require your bundled JS file instead of requiring all files in the directory:
```javascript
require_tree . => require main.bundle
```
7. Whatever script initializes your JS application, (often `init.js` or
`index.js` or `my_app.js`), require that in your webpack entry point.
8. Use [CommonJS][common-js] or [AMD][amd] statements to load dependencies in
your JS files.  [6-8][6-8]
9. `webpack -wc` to generate or re-generate your bundled JS.  [9][9]

To run the project locally (assuming you have Ruby 2.1.1 and Rails 4):
 * `bundle`
 * `rails s`
